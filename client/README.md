CodeWorks Vue Starter
=====================
Clicker town is a mobile multiplayer app that will be a resource managment clicker type game... You take on roles within the town you join are invite too.. There will be a local town board that you can post requests or a daily deal..
We want to show how to work with data and implement algorithims, also want to use lazy loading as a preventive measure against cheaters and hackers... I want to also delve more into MySql with this project and implement html canvas.
Features will include a chat system, trade system, and basic clicker abilites that pretain to the users skill level and building levels ect/ (to be expanded) 
Stretch goals is to interact with other towns by creating trade networks
super stretch goals is creating it so your character can become a adventure and do quests missions for rare materials for special building upgrades /item in the town.

Most imporant thing is applying what we are learning: polymorphism, lazy loading, algorithims. 
secondly learning: sql join commands to show fun facts.. Like town population and totals of all players at the town
Thirdly working with: socket type servers for messenger boards posts, daily deals.
